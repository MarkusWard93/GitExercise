Markus had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Markus went,
the lamb was sure to go.
 
It followed him to school one day
which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
to see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
but still it lingered near,

And waited patiently about,
till Markus did appear.

“Why does the lamb love Markus so?”
the eager children cry.

“Why, Markus loves the lamb, you know.”
the teacher did reply
